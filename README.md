Algorithm:

Program 1: Even or Odd Number Checker
Start: Begin program execution.
Declare Variable: Create an integer variable num to store the userâ€™s input.
Prompt User: Display the message "Enter a integer to check for even or odd" to request input.
Read Input: Accept an integer from the user and store it in num.

Program 2: Vowel or Consonant Checker
This program checks whether the entered character is a vowel or a consonant. It compares the character against both uppercase and lowercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U, a, e, i, o, u) using logical OR (||) operators. Any other alphabetic character is considered a consonant.


Program 3: Finding the Largest of Three Numbers
This program compares three numbers and determines the largest one using nested if statements. It performs sequential comparisons between all three inputs to identify the maximum.

Program 4:
Switch case has been used in this case
Switch case allows multiple options using case
Break is also used
Default case can be used

Program 5:
Same switch case is used
Cases include addition subtraction multiplication and division
Input will be taken from the user and the case which matches will be used
