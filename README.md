Program 1: Even or Odd Number Checker
This program determines whether a given integer is even or odd using the modulus operator (%). If the number is divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0), it is even; otherwise, it is odd. The logic is implemented using a basic if-else conditional block.

Program 2: Vowel or Consonant Checker
This program checks whether the entered character is a vowel or a consonant. It compares the character against both uppercase and lowercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U, a, e, i, o, u) using logical OR (||) operators. Any other alphabetic character is considered a consonant.

Program 3: Finding the Largest of Three Numbers
This program compares three numbers and determines the largest one using nested if statements. It performs sequential comparisons between all three inputs to identify the maximum.

Program 4:
Switch case has been used in this case
Switch case allows multiple options using case
Break is also used
Default case can be used

Program 5:
Same switch case is used
Cases include addition subtraction multiplication and division
Input will be taken from the user and the case which matches will be used
